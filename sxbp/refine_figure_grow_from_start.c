 *     - SetLineLength(CurrentLine, 1)
 *
 * - SetLineLength(line, length)
 *     - Try and SET 'line' length to 'length'
 *     - IF this causes a collision:
 *         - NOTE the line that it collided with (CollidedLine)
 *         - SetLineLength(
 *               PreviousLine, EvadeDistance(CurrentLine, CollidedLine)
 *           )
 *
 * - EvadeDistance(PreviousLine, CurrentLine, CollidedLine)
 *     - COMPARE PreviousLine, CurrentLine and CollidedLine lengths, directions
 *       and positions to work out what length PreviousLine should be in order
 *       for CurrentLine to not collide with CollidedLine
 *     - RETURN new distance for PreviousLine
